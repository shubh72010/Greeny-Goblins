 * on five independently-populating flows, then streams artwork in over the

 * re-records the entire tree. Locally the same screen settles once and never
 * records again — which is the whole of why offline feels smoother than online on
 * identical glass.
 *
 * Throttling bounds that regardless of what dirtied the tree. The screen itself
 * stays live and correct the whole time (skipped frames take Compose's ordinary
 * incremental draw path); only the blur behind the chrome lags, by at most this
 * long, against content that is by definition still changing.
