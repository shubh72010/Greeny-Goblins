/**
 * The app's motion language, in one place.
 *
 * Every animation in the app is supposed to be one of these. Before this existed
 * there were 44 hand-written `spring(`s, 169 `tween(`s and 153 `animate*` call
 * sites across 120 files, each picking its own timing — which is why two things
 * that move together (a nav bar and the page behind it, a puck and the tab it
 * marks) so often moved on visibly different clocks.
 *
 * The numbers are not taste. [MorphStiffness] is regressed off the iOS 27 reference
 * capture in `designRefrence/shared transition animation.mp4`; the rest derive from it
 * so that everything in the app reads as the same physical material.
 *
 * Springs, not tweens, wherever a value can be interrupted mid-flight — a spring
 * carries its velocity across the interruption and a tween restarts. Tweens are
 * kept only for pure cross-fades, where there is no velocity to preserve.

     * Container morph: a tile opening into a detail screen, and back.

     * Measured off the reference capture by recovering the morphing card's scale per
     * frame (multi-scale template match against the settled detail screen), over two
     * independent takes of each direction. Push reaches 99% in ~265ms, pop in ~230ms,
     * neither overshoots.
     *
     * Fitted to the SETTLE TIME, not to the per-frame shape. At 30fps a card crossing
     * the screen in a quarter of a second is heavily motion-blurred in exactly the
     * mid-transition frames, and blur biases a template match's scale estimate — the
     * measured mid-frames are not trustworthy enough to regress a curve shape from,
     * and pretending otherwise would be fitting the capture's blur, not Apple's
     * animation. Duration and the absence of overshoot are solid; both directions
     * average to a critically damped spring with a ~0.24s natural period.
     *
     * stiffness = (2*pi / 0.24)^2 ~= 700.
     *
     * The previous value was 195 (a 0.45s period) — ~3.6x slower to settle than the
     * reference. That one number was most of why the morph did not read as iOS: the
     * curve shape was already close, the clock was wrong.
